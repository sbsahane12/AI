# Q.1) Python program that demonstrates the hill climbing algorithm to find the maximum of a mathematical function.

def hill_climbing(start, func, step_size=0.1, max_iter=100):
    current = start
    for _ in range(max_iter):

            current = next_move
        else:
            break

# Example mathematical function: f(x) = -(x-3)^2 + 5 (a simple parabola with maximum at x=3)
def func(x):
    return -(x - 3)**2 + 5
